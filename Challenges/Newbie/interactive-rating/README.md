This is my solution to the [Interactive Rating Component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI). The project simulates a user rating experience using a simple and interactive UI component.

The entire layout is built using **semantic HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**, with dynamic visual feedback for user interaction. I customized the project structure and component styling to ensure clarity, accessibility, and responsiveness across devices.
