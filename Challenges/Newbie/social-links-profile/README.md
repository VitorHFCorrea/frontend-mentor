# Frontend Mentor - Social Links Profile

This is my solution to the [Social Links Profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). It's a simple and responsive profile card built using semantic HTML and Tailwind CSS. This project helped me solidify core CSS layout skills and understand responsive design better.

In this version, I personalized the project with **my own name, location, photo, and social media links**, turning the generic layout into a fully customized profile card.

### What I Practiced

While building this project, I practiced:

- Utility-first CSS with Tailwind
- Layout structuring with `flex`, `gap`, and responsive sizing
- Custom colors and fonts via Tailwind configuration
- Managing hover and transition effects with Tailwind classes
- Responsiveness using Tailwind

```html
<a class="hover:bg-mygreen hover:text-mygrey-900 transition-colors">
  GitHub
</a>
```

```css
/* Custom colors used via Tailwind config */
--color-mygreen: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
```
