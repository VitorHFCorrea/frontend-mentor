This is my solution to the [Social Links Profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). It's a simple and responsive profile card built using semantic HTML and Tailwind CSS.

In this version, I personalized the project with **my own name, location, photo, and social media links**, turning the generic layout into a fully customized profile card.
